        <h2 class="section__title">TYPES OF BILLIARD GAME</h2>
        <p class="section__subtitle">1) 8-ball<br><br>
          There are many various types of billiard games to pick from, but the most popular billiard game is 8 ball.
          8-ball pool, often known as stripes and solids, is a popular pool variant enjoyed by both beginners and experts.
          There are six pockets on the playing table. A white cue ball, seven solid balls, seven striped balls, and a black 8-ball are used to begin the game.
          The balls are initially clustered, then one player distributes them by hitting a break shot. When a player legally pockets a solid ball, the opposing player is allocated stripes. The opposite is also true.
          Once a player has cleared all of their lawfully allotted balls, the goal of the game is to pocket the 8-ball in a called pocket. The opponent wins if you pocket the black ball before cleaning your balls. The same holds true if you’ve cleared the table but pocket both the cue ball and the 8-ball on the final shot.<br><br>2) Nine-ball<br><br> (sometimes written 9-ball) is a discipline of the cue sport pool. The game's origins are traceable to the 1920s in the United States. It is played on a rectangular billiard table with pockets at each of the four corners and in the middle of each long side. Using a cue stick, players must strike the white cue ball to pocket nine colored billiard balls, hitting them in ascending numerical order. An individual game (or rack) is won by the player pocketing the 9 ball. Matches are usually played as a race to a set number of racks, with the player who reaches the set number winning the match.<br><br>3) Ten-ball <br><br> is a rotation pool game similar to nine-ball, but using ten balls instead of nine, and with the 10 ball instead of the 9 as the "money ball".<br><br>4) Balkline and Straight Rail<br><br>Balkline is a broad phrase that refers to carom billiards, which is played with a red object ball and two cue balls as opposed to a white object ball. The playing table is ten feet by five feet in size and does not have pockets, but it does have divisions known as balk spaces, which are denoted by balklines.
          Fans claimed that the game was too easy before the balklines were introduced, and that the top players were scoring an excessive number of points as a result. As a result, balklines were added to the game in order to make it tougher for players while also being more exciting for viewers.
          There were no balklines in the game, which was originally known as straight rail. In order to earn a point, you had to hit both object balls with the cue ball in a single motion with the cue ball. A player wins if he or she accumulates the number of points that has been agreed upon by the other players.<br><br> 5) Carom <br><br>
          This game is popularly known as Carom or Carambola, and the billiard tables used are typically pocketless. 
          The point of this game is for players to show off their skills by effectively hitting their cue balls over their opponent’s cue ball, and directly into a specific object ball.
          One has to do this in one shot— and in doing so they get a point. This game has multiple variations, so players ultimately get to choose which one they’d like to play.
          The most popular one is played upon a straight rail without extraneous scoring restrictions. 
          On the other hand, another variation is the Balkline, which is characterized by its many restrictive rules in play. Playing this version of the game requires the players to divide the table into balk spaces (i.e. multiple preset areas). 
          Yet another version of the carom game is the Artistic billiards, which is more entertainment-based than the other variations. In this one, players must perform a total of seventy-six different shots— all of which are set at different difficulty levels and number of points.<br><br> </p>
