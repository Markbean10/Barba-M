        <h2 class="section__title">HISTORY OF BILLIARD</h2>
        <p class="section__subtitle">Origins (15th Century)<br><br>
          Billiards traces its roots back to the 15th century, likely evolving from similar outdoor games played in Europe. These early games were akin to lawn sports where players struck wooden balls with sticks. The game was initially played on grass, but as it gained popularity, players sought a more controlled environment.
          
          Transition to Indoor Play: By the late 15th century, billiards transitioned indoors, with the introduction of a rectangular table covered with a felt-like cloth. The tables featured side cushions, which allowed for new strategies and increased skill in play. This transformation marked the beginning of billiards as we know it today.<br><br>
          16th Century: Popularization<br><br>
          As billiards became more refined, it gained traction among the nobility and was often played in royal courts across Europe.
          
          Royal Patronage: The game became a symbol of status, attracting the attention of kings and queens. Its popularity spread from France to England and other parts of Europe. This royal endorsement helped standardize some of the rules, though variations still existed across regions.
          
          Emergence of Variations: During this period, different cultures began to develop their own styles of billiards. In France, a version known as carom emerged, where players aimed to score points by bouncing balls off the cushions. This variation emphasized skillful shot-making and strategic thinking.<br><br>
          
          17th Century: Development of Rules and Equipment<br><br>
          The 17th century was crucial for the formalization of billiards as a competitive game.
          
          Standardization of Rules: As the game grew in popularity, the need for standardized rules became apparent. Different regions started to adopt more formal regulations, which made it easier to organize competitions. This era laid the groundwork for future international rules and competitions.
          
          Cue and Ball Innovations: The equipment used in billiards also evolved during this time. The use of cues—long sticks designed to strike the balls—became widespread, replacing the earlier maces. Additionally, the materials used for the balls transitioned from wood to ivory, providing better playability and feel.<br><br>
          
          18th Century: The Birth of Modern Billiards<br><br>
          The 18th century witnessed significant advancements that shaped modern billiards.
          
          Introduction of Three-Cushion Billiards: This variation required players to strike the cue ball so it made contact with both object balls and hit at least three cushions before scoring. This version of the game introduced a new level of complexity and strategy, appealing to more skilled players.
          
          Emergence of Pocket Billiards: Around the same time, the concept of pocket billiards began to gain traction. The term "pool" originally referred to a betting game played in taverns, where players would wager on various games, including billiards. As pocket billiards became more popular, the game evolved into distinct forms, leading to the variety of pool games we recognize today.<br><br>

          Professionalization of the Sport: With the establishment of formal tournaments, billiards began to attract professional players. The first official billiards championship was held in the mid-19th century, and this competitive spirit helped to elevate the game’s profile.
          
          Technological Advances: Innovations in table design, particularly the introduction of rubber cushions, greatly enhanced gameplay. This advancement allowed for more accurate shots and dynamic play. Mass production of billiard tables and equipment made the sport accessible to the general public, leading to the establishment of billiard halls and clubs.<br><br>
